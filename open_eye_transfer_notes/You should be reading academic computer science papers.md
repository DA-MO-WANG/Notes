* a better programmer==>read documentation、tutorials
* 拿到先机，前沿==>academic research



> As working programmers, you need to keep learning all the time. You check out tutorials, documentation, Stack Overflow questions, anything you can find that will help you write code and keep your skills current. But how often do you find yourself digging into academic computer science papers to improve your programming chops?

只要还是编程er, 你需要一只保持学习。你如果要找到能够对你写代码有帮助的东西，还有保持你的技巧熟练，你可以查看教程、文档、问答网站等其他东西。但是你多久一次挖掘论文，为了提升你的编程斧头。

> While the tutorials can help you write code right now, it’s the academic papers that can help you understand where programming came from and where it’s going. Every programming feature, from the null pointer (aka [the billion dollar mistake](https://qconlondon.com/london-2009/qconlondon.com/london-2009/speaker/Tony+Hoare.html)) to objects (via [Smalltalk](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/142327/what-did-they-call-object-oriented-programming-before-alan-kay-invented-the-term/142330#142330)) has been built on a foundation of research that stretches back to the 1960s (and earlier). Future innovations will be built on the research of today.
